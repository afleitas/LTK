# Ecommerce Returns Prediction Challenge

This repository contains my full work for the Ecommerce Returns Prediction task.

The goal of the project is to predict which orders are likely to be returned, so the company can contact those customers before the return happens. This can reduce the cost of returns and save money.

Inside this repo, you will find:
- Data exploration and baseline model
- Model improvements with Random Forest
- Business evaluation and cost analysis
- Monitoring plan and executive summary

The focus of the solution is not only accuracy, but also business value. The model improves recall for returns and can generate positive financial impact if used correctly.

This work was done as part of a technical challenge.
